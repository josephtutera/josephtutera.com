<div style="margin-bottom:30px;"><i>Currently: Living in Kansas City, Building <a href="https://carepilot.com">CarePilot</a>.</i></div>
  <p><b>Hello, my name is Joseph, I don't know why you're here, but I guess we're doing this.</b></div>
  <p>I asked ChatGPT to write a majority of this for me based my internet presence, so I apologize in advance.</p>
<p>I'm 23 years old, and I'm currently living in Kansas City. I'm building <a href="https://carepilot.com">CarePilot</a>, a startup that I co-founded with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamrblake/">Adam</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/techgaun/">Samar</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tannerhelton/">Tanner</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnohearnfache/">John</a>.</p>
<p>CarePilot is an AI-powered medical scribe that helps healthcare providers write notes and code their visits at the point of care.</p>
<p>It has 40 clients in 12 states. It's incredibly hard, stressful, but I'm having a lot of fun.</p>
<h3>Priors</h3>
<p>I went to TCU (Go Frogs), and got a good GPA, but I rarely paid attention in lecture. (Sorry, Parents.)</p>
<p>I majored in Finance, and was part of NLP, which is a leadership program in the business school. My general view is that academia is a waste of time.</p>
<p>That said, I made a lot of friends, joined a good fraternity, and connected with some of my co-founders through TCU, so i'll take that as a win.</p>
<p>I started a PPE (Masks, Glvoes, Test Kits) supplier when I was a freshman/sophomore, and it was my equivalent of an MBA. I learned a lot about <b>success</b>, more about <b>failure</b>, and got a better business education than I ever would have in a classroom. Consider myself educated.</p>
<h3>Something interesting</h3>
<p>When I was 16 years old, I <b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/07/us/elections/results-kansas-primary-elections.html">ran for Governor of Kansas</a></b> and got about .5% of the 2018 primary vote.</p>
<p>While I could not legally vote for myself, I was legally allowed to run for office. They've since <a href="https://www.kwch.com/content/news/New-law-requires-Kansas-governor-candidates-to-be-at-least-25-years-old-483075941.html">changed the law</a>.</p>
<p>To the 5 people in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_County,_Kansas">Ford County</a>, Kansas who voted for me, I thank you.</p>
<p>I did interviews with most <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/us/kansas-governor-race-teenagers.html">major</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71vLu9tXXJo">media</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/vote-kansas-teens-running-governor/story?id=57058542">networks</a>, and showed me just enough to know that I don't want to hold public office.</p>
<h3>Something personal</h3>
<p>My favorite artist is <b><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6M2wZ9GZgrQXHCFfjv46we?si=uvo0PU9dTwiSRfcR58o07w">Dua Lipa</a></b>, and my favorite book is <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqYJrbmVS0Y&ab_channel=PoliticsandProse">Leonardo da Vinci</a></b> by Walter Isaacson.</p>

<p>This website serves as a substitute for my resume, which I have no interest in maintaining.</p>
