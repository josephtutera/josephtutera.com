  <div style="margin-bottom:30px;"><i>Currently: Living in Kansas City, working on CarePilot.</i></div>
    <p><b>Hello, my name is Joseph, I don't know why you're here, but I guess we're doing this.</b>I asked ChatGPT to write a majority of this for me based my internet presence, so I apologize in advance.</p>
  <p>I'm 23 years old, and I'm currently living in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm currently working on CarePilot, a startup that I co-founded.</p>
  <p>CarePilot is an AI-powered medical scribe that helps doctors write notes and code their visits at the point of care.</p>
  <p>It has 40 clients in 12 states. It's incredibly hard, stressful, but I'm having a lot of fun.</p>
  <h3>Priors</h3>
  <p>I went to TCU, and managed to get a good GPA, but I rarely paid attention in class. (Sorry, Parents.)</p>
  <p>I majored in finace, and was part of NLP, which is a leadership program in the business school. My general view is that academia is a waste of time. But I made a lot of friends, joined a good fraternity, and connected with my co-founders through TCU, so i'll take that as a win.</p>
  <p>I started a PPE (Masks, Glvoes, Test Kits) supplier when I was a 19, and it was my equivalent of an MBA. I learned a lot about success, more about failure, and got a better business education than I ever would have in a classroom. Consider myself humbled.</p>
  <h3>Something interesting</h3>
  <p>When I was in high school, I <b><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/07/us/elections/results-kansas-primary-elections.html">ran for Governor of Kansas</a></b> and got about .5% of the 2018 primary vote.</p>
  <p>I had absolutely no idea what I was doing.</p>
  <p>I did interviews with most major media networks, and showed me just enough to know that I don't want to hold public office.</p>
  <h3>Something personal</h3>
  <p>My favorite artist is <b><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6M2wZ9GZgrQXHCFfjv46we?si=uvo0PU9dTwiSRfcR58o07w">Dua Lipa</a></b>, and my favorite book is <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqYJrbmVS0Y&ab_channel=PoliticsandProse">Leonardo da Vinci</a></b> by Walter Isaacson.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This website serves as a substitute for my resume, which I have no interest in maintaining.</p>
